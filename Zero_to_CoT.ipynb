Diabetes and glaucoma should also be considered, as well as stress or tension headaches. The patient should seek urgent medical evaluation, including blood tests, an eye examination, and possibly an MRI or CT scan of the brain. A detailed history of the headaches and any potential triggers is also crucial for accurate diagnosis.\n"
